Challenge: Connections Homes is a nonprofit organization dedicated to connecting young adults to families. Every year in our country an estimated 85,000 young men and women between the ages of 18 â€“ 24 are living life unconnected to family or any caring stable adult. These young people are living on our streets, in our shelters, and in dangerous situations like sex trafficking because they have nowhere to turn. Connections Homes helps these young adults by finding a family who will help them with their life. 

Currently, Connections Homes uses a manual process to match a youth with a mentoring family which is time-consuming and prone to errors. We would like to contribute to this great movement by creating a Matching API.
